# FreeCodeCamp.org Project: Portfolio Page (old)
### _(Check out my new portfolio [here](https://github.com/illyriandev/illyriandvd))_

This is a static website coded in HTML & CSS, which was my final project for the [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org) course on Responsive Web Design, after which I moved on to their Front-End course to learn Javascript.
